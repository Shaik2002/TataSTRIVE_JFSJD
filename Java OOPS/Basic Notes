OOP - Object Oriented Programming
OOP is Methodology/Paradigm to design a program using Classes and Objects.
Deals with real world problems
a. Abstraction - Hiding the internal features and Displaying the functionality
b. Polymorphism - Performing single task in Multiple ways
c. Inheritance - Inheriting the properties from parent class to child class
d. Encapsulation - Binding/Raping of data into a single unit

Object - Real World Entity - An entity has that has state and behaviour is known as object
State : Represents data/attributes
Behaviour : Represents Methods(Functionality)
Object is instance of a class that executes the class
Can Create Multiple objects for a Class
new is keyword used to create an object [ ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName(); ]

Class - Storage Container - It is a blueprint from which individual objects are created

Methods - Collection of statements that are grouped to perform an operation
Must be declared within a class
Data Can be passed as a parameter in method
It will get executed once it is called, it should be followed by ()
PreDefined and UserDefined

Constructor

Method Overloading{Static} - Compile Time [Ability to define multiple methods within the same class
 with same name but with different parameter]
Method Overriding{Dynamic} - Run  Time [Methods having same name and same/different parameters
within both parent and child class it overrides it]

class - class --> Extends
interface - class --> Implements [Multiple Inheritance]
interface - interface --> Extends
