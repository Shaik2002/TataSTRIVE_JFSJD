JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API in Java that allows applications to interact with relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.  

Steps to Connect Java with Database  
1. Load the JDBC Driver – Register the database driver.  
2. Establish Connection – Connect to the database using DriverManager.  
3. Create a Statement – Execute SQL queries.  
4. Execute Query – Retrieve or modify data.  
5. Process the Results – Handle the fetched data.  
6. Close the Connection – Free resources after execution.  

JDBC Components  
- DriverManager: Manages database drivers.  
- Connection: Establishes a connection with the database.  
- Statement: Executes SQL queries.  
- PreparedStatement: Precompiled SQL queries for better performance.  
- ResultSet: Stores the query results.  

Connecting to a Database (Example for MySQL)  
- Load MySQL JDBC Driver  
- Create a Connection using DriverManager.getConnection()  
- Execute Queries using Statement or PreparedStatement
