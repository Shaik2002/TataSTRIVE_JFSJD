Arrays
   - Arrays are fixed-size, homogeneous collections of elements.  
   - Supports 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays.  
   - Java provides the `Arrays` class for utility methods like `sort()`, `binarySearch()`, etc.  

Multithreading  
   - Java supports concurrent execution using `Thread` and `Runnable`.  
   - Threads can be created by extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`.  
   - Synchronization prevents race conditions using `synchronized` blocks.  

Java 8 Features  
   - Lambda Expressions – Enables functional programming and concise code.  
   - Streams API – Supports filtering, mapping, and reducing collections efficiently.  
   - Default & Static Methods – Interfaces can have method implementations.  
   - Optional Class – Helps avoid `NullPointerException`.  

Exception Handling  
   - Java uses `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, and `throws` for error handling.  
   - Checked exceptions (like `IOException`) must be handled at compile-time.  
   - Unchecked exceptions (like `NullPointerException`) occur at runtime.
