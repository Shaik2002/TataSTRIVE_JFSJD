React.js is a JavaScript library used for building fast and interactive user interfaces (UI). 
It is component-based, declarative, and efficient, making it popular for modern web development.  

Component-Based – UI is built using reusable components.  
Virtual DOM – Improves performance by updating only changed parts of the UI.  
JSX (JavaScript XML) – Allows writing HTML inside JavaScript.  
Unidirectional Data Flow– Makes data management predictable.  
Hooks– Enables functional components to use state and lifecycle features.
