Java was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1991, officially released in 1995. It evolved with major updates like Java SE 8 (Lambdas) and Java SE 17 (LTS).
Platform-Independent – Java programs run on any platform without modification using the (JVM), following the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle.  
Simple & Readable – Java syntax is similar to C/C++, but it removes complexities like pointers and manual memory management.  
Robust & Secure – Features like strong memory management, exception handling, and a security manager make Java reliable and safe for applications.  
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runs Java bytecode.  
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Includes JVM + libraries for execution.  
JDK (Java Development Kit): Includes JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger, etc.).
