JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language used for making web pages interactive. 
It runs in browsers and enables dynamic content manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.  

JavaScript Basics
- JavaScript is client-side(runs in browsers) but can also be used on the server-side (Node.js).  
- It follows the ECMAScript standard.  
- Can be included inline, internally in <script> tags, or externally via .js files.  

DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation  
- JavaScript can access and modify HTML elements dynamically.  
- Methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), innerHTML, and addEventListener() are used.  

Events & Event Handling
- JavaScript can respond to user actions like clicks, keypresses, form submissions.  
- Events can be handled using onclick, onchange, or addEventListener().  

Asynchronous JavaScript  
- Callbacks: Functions passed as arguments to be executed later.  
- Promises: Handle asynchronous tasks (.then(), .catch()).  
- Async/Await: Cleaner syntax for handling asynchronous code.
